# Wordle Game in C (CLI)

Welcome to the Wordle Game implemented in C! This repository contains the code for a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) version of the popular Wordle game. It allows players to guess a 5-letter word with feedback after each guess, similar to the original game mechanics.

## Features

- **5-Letter Word Guessing:** Players are tasked with guessing a 5-letter word.
- **Feedback for Each Guess:**
  - **Green**: Correct letter and correct position.
  - **Yellow**: Correct letter but wrong position.
  - **Gray**: Letter not in the word at all.
- **Word List:** A list of valid words is used to choose the secret word and for user guesses.
- **CLI Interface:** The game is played entirely in the terminal, making it lightweight and fast.
